AI disclosure:

The following prompts were used with an AI language model during the development of this work.

1. How do I write an AI usage disclosure? What are the common formats?
2. What is a good testing framework, style guide, and GUI library for python? 
3. 2_unittest has 0 tests ran when run. What is the error?
4. How do I use the tkinter library with simple code in python? 
5. The current code creates a diagonal line underneath the radio button. How do I change it to a horizontal line under the radio button?
6. Can you fix all files to follow the PEP 8 style guide and note changes made? (note: these notes were left in the code on purpose for disclosure purposes)
7. Why isn't the second radiobutton visible in the gui?
